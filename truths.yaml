truths:
  - The truth waits for you. 
  - The truth sees all.
  - And we see truth.
  - It was not too long ago.
  - When the earth turned dark and pale.
  - From the ashes rose.
  - Another. And Another. And Another.
  - She dashed through the night.
  - Fighting against the darkness.
  - An infectious plague.
  - An invisble force.
  - She saught the light. 
  - To find the lit candle in the dark.
  - The cradle of life amongst the dead.
  - It is the year 2034.
  - The world is in chaos.
  - Dawn simmers in the horizon.
  - In the distance, a figure emerges.
  - Out of the rubble, the horrific decay.
  - She appears, a beacon of hope, scathed by the plague.
  - Crumbling ruins tower over her, modern giants succumbing to agony
  - She glances back, her eyes filled with sorrow.
  - But no matter, for the past is too far gone.
  - Yet as she moves forward, the truth remains.
  - Each step she takes, further is the hurt.
  - That the past is gone.
  - The tears she sheds, the present evaporating to dust.
  - Just like the zombies that shy away from the piercing sun.
  - She walks on.
  - And walks on.
  - Because the past waits for no one, for no tear.
  - It will all crumble away.
  - She scours through the rubble, seeking all what she can seek.
  - She hears the groans of zombies that mindlessly march through the dark.
