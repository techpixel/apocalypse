truths:
  - Transmission Recieved. Memories required to process.
  - The truth waits for you...
  - It was not too long ago.
  - When the earth turned dark and pale.
  - From the ashes rose...death.
  - Another. And Another. And Another.
  - An infectious plague. An invisble force.
  - The cradle of life amongst the dead.
  - It is the year 2034. The world is in chaos.
  - Dawn simmers in the horizon. In the distance, a figure emerges.
  - Out of the rubble, the horrific decay.
  - They appear, a beacon of hope, scathed by the plague.
  - Crumbling ruins tower over the, modern giants succumbing to agony
  - They glance back, their eyes filled with sorrow.
  - But no matter, for the past is too far gone.
  - Yet as they move forward, the truth remains.
  - Each step they take, further is the hurt.
  - The constant reminder that the past is gone.
  - The tears they shed, the present evaporating to dust.
  - Just like the zombies that shy away from the piercing sun.
  - They walk on. And walk on. 
  - Because the past waits for no one, for no tear.
  - It will all crumble away.
  - They scour through the rubble, seeking all what they can seek.
  - They hear the groans of zombies that mindlessly march through the dark.
  - They hide under the blanket of the sky when they see them walk by.
  - Their eerie green eyes shine in the dark. A fearing glow.
  - They scouts for the last savehaven. A way to move forward.
  - But when the past eats you by the soul, it is hard to push on.
  - Focused on forward, they lost sight of the past.
  - They seek remembrance. They seek the future.
